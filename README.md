End to end solution for the travelling salesman problem using a greedy algorithm. 



Real-world setup of the problem allowing for a list of cities to be visited as input for the data. The coordinates of the cities are retrieved using GeoPy. 
A simple greedy algorithm is used to solve the problem by always picking the closest unvisited city. 
MLOps approach to project, tests have been developed and are ran automatically with every push using GitHub actions. The entire solution piepline is automated and tested.
